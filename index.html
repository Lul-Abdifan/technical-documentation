           <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can
                be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript 
                be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example</p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <ol><p>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML
                             form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
                              and page navigation.</p></ol>
                              <ol><p>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of informatio
                                   from one invocation to another of the application, or perform 
                                   file manipulations on a server.</p></ol>

                    </ul>

         <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
           <ul>
               <ol>
                   <p>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</p>
               </ol>
               <ol><p>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</p></ol>
               <ol><p>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming,
                    try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</p></ol>
           </ul>

        <section  class="main-section" id="#JavaScript and Java"><header><h1>JavaScript and Java</h1></header>
            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. 
                JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow 
                constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to 
                JavaScript.</p>

                <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements.
                     Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
