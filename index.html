           <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can
                be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript 
                be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example</p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML
                             form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
                              and page navigation.</li>
                              <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of informatio
                                   from one invocation to another of the application, or perform 
                                   file manipulations on a server.</li>

                    </ul>
                </p>
        </section>

        <section  class="main-section" id="What you should already know"><header><h1>What you should already know</h1></header>
         <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
           <ul>
              
                   <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
               
                   <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).<li>
                  <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming,
                    try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>
           </ul>
        </section>
        <section  class="main-section" id="JavaScript and Java"><header><h1>JavaScript and Java</h1></header>
            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. 
                JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow 
                constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to 
                JavaScript.</p>

                <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements.
                     Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>

        <section  class="main-section" id="Hello world"><header><h1>Hello world</h1></header>
        
        </section>
        <section  class="main-section" id="Variables"><header><h1>Variables</h1></header></section>
        <section  class="main-section" id="Declaring variables"><header><h1>Declaring variables</h1></header></section>
        <section  class="main-section" id="Variable scope"><header><h1>Variable scope</h1></header></section>
        <section  class="main-section" id="Global variables"><header><h1>Global variables</h1></header></section>

        <section  class="main-section" id="Constants"><header><h1>Constants</h1></header>
        <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same 
            as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.

        </p>
        <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
        <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.</p>
        <p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to rep
            resent a variable.</p>
        <p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:

        </p>
        <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS
            WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
            //statements }</code>
            <p>However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.
            </p>
            <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key =
                "otherValue";</code>
        
        </section>

        <section  class="main-section" id="#ata types"><header><h1>Data types</h1></header>
        <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Six data types that are primitives:
                <ul>
                <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.
                    undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.
                    </li>
                <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.
                </li>
                <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.
                </li>
                <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.
                </li>
            </li></ul>
            <li>and Object</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.
        </p>
        
        
        </section>
        <section  class="main-section" id="if...else statement"><header><h1>if...else statement</h1></header></section>
     <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
    </p>
  <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
  <p>condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if statements.</p>
        <p>You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:

        </p>
        <code>if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {
            statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {
            statement_last; }</code>
            <p>In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:
            </p>
            <code>
                if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                    statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
                    statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
                    statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }
            </code>
            <p>It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment 
                can be confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:
            </p>
            <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code>
            <p>If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:</p>
               <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>
